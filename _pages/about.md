I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University (Professor Wei Chenâ€™s Lab). I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University (Professor Yongming Liu's Lab). The overarching objective of my research is physics-based uncertainty-aware data-driven for the analysis and design under uncertainty for advanced materials systems. My Ph.D. dissertation is on uncertainty quantification and analysis using Bayesian statistics and Machine learning (ML). I developed a physics-guided and multi-fidelity learning framework for both analysis and uncertainty quantification. The main applications are probabilistic materials property modeling (e.g., strength, fatigue life, fatigue crack) in conventional and advanced manufacturing (such as additive manufacturing). My postdoctoral research extends the scales of materials modeling from property to processing and structure. It emphasizes automated materials characterization, screening, and process-structure-property relation modeling using physics-based machine learning with uncertainty quantification. The applications encompass directed energy deposition additive manufacturing and catalyst discovery, both contributing significantly to energy efficiency and environmental conservation efforts.
