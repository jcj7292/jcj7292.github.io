I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Virginia Tech. I was a Postdoctoral Fellow in Mechanical Engineering at Northwestern University (Professor Wei Chen’s Lab). I earned my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Arizona State University (Professor Yongming Liu's Lab). 

The overarching objective of my research is physics-based uncertainty-aware data-driven analysis and design under uncertainty for advanced materials systems. My Ph.D. dissertation is on uncertainty quantification and analysis using Bayesian statistics and Machine learning (ML). I developed a physics-guided and multi-fidelity learning framework for both analysis and uncertainty quantification. The main applications are probabilistic materials property modeling (e.g., strength, fatigue life, fatigue crack) in conventional and advanced manufacturing (such as additive manufacturing). My postdoctoral research extends the scales of materials modeling from property to processing and structure. It emphasizes automated materials characterization, screening, and process-structure-property relation modeling using physics-based machine learning with uncertainty quantification. The applications encompass directed energy deposition additive manufacturing and catalyst discovery, both contributing significantly to energy efficiency and environmental conservation efforts.

**For Prospective PhD Students**: The Stochastic Engineering Analysis and Design (SEAD) Lab directed by Dr. Jie Chen at Virginia Tech has openings for fully-funded Ph.D. positions starting Fall 2024 or Spring/Fall 2025. 
Our group focuses on (1) Physics for ML: incorporating knowledge from engineering analysis and design into probabilistic Machine Learning (ML) algorithm development and (2) ML for Physics: applying ML to solve intricate problems in engineering analysis and design under uncertainties. The main engineering fields include fatigue and fracture, additive manufacturing, digital twins, and materials discovery. 
To apply, please email your CV, transcripts, and a short description of your research interest (≤ 500 words) to Dr. Jie Chen at jiechen@vt.edu.
